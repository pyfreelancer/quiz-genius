üöÄ Technologies Used
Streamlit: For building interactive web applications in Python.

Google Gemini API (via LangChain): For advanced AI-powered text generation.

Python-dotenv: For managing environment variables (like API keys).

PyPDF2: For extracting text from PDF documents.

python-docx: For extracting text from DOCX documents.

HTML/CSS: For custom UI elements and styling (integrated within Streamlit).

Tailwind CSS (conceptually): The custom CSS is inspired by Tailwind's utility-first approach for responsive design.

‚öôÔ∏è Setup and Local Installation
Follow these steps to get QuizGenius running on your local machine.

1. Clone the Repository
git clone https://github.com/YOUR_USERNAME/MCQ_GENERATOR_AI.git
cd MCQ_GENERATOR_AI

(Replace YOUR_USERNAME with your actual GitHub username)

2. Create a Virtual Environment (Recommended)
python -m venv venv

3. Activate the Virtual Environment
On Windows:

.\venv\Scripts\activate

On macOS/Linux:

source venv/bin/activate

4. Install Dependencies
Install all required Python packages using the requirements.txt file:

pip install -r requirements.txt

5. Configure Your Gemini API Key
Get a Gemini API Key: If you don't have one, obtain a Google Gemini API key from Google AI Studio.

Create a .env file: In the root directory of your project (MCQ_GENERATOR_AI/), create a new file named .env.

Add your API Key: Open the .env file and add your Gemini API key in the following format:

GEMINI_API_KEY="YOUR_ACTUAL_GEMINI_API_KEY_HERE"

Important: Ensure there are no spaces around the = sign. This file is ignored by Git (.gitignore) to protect your sensitive key.

6. Run the Application
Once all dependencies are installed and your API key is configured, run the Streamlit application:

streamlit run app.py

This command will open the application in your default web browser (usually at http://localhost:8501).

üåê Deployment to Streamlit Community Cloud
This application is designed for easy deployment to Streamlit Community Cloud.

Host on GitHub: Ensure your project (excluding the .env file, which should be in .gitignore) is pushed to a public GitHub repository.

Streamlit Cloud: Log in to Streamlit Community Cloud with your GitHub account.

New App: Click "New app" and select your MCQ_GENERATOR_AI repository and app.py as the main file.

Secrets: Crucially, add your GEMINI_API_KEY as a secret in the "Advanced settings" section of the deployment configuration. The format should be GEMINI_API_KEY="YOUR_ACTUAL_GEMINI_API_KEY_HERE".

Deploy: Click "Deploy!" to get your live, shareable web link.
